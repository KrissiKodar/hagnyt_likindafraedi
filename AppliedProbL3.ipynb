    "Entropy measures the uncertainty or disorder of a distribution. For example, a uniform distribution, like the toss of a die, has a high uncertainty because all values can occur with equal probability. The uncertainty is lower in, e.g., the sum of two dice, where the probability of obtaining a 7 is higher than the probability of obtaining other values, so there is some level of certainty, or lower level of uncertainty. The same concept exists in thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, which measures the disorder within a system (e.g., a system with high entropy can be in many different states), and in information theory where the value of new information can be measured as the drop in enthropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enthropy for a discrete random variable $X$ is defined as\n",

    "$$H = -\\sum_x{p(x)log(p(x))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Compute the enthropy of a Bernoulli random variable with $p=0.3$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that the maximum enthropy, or disorder, is obtained when all the $p_X(x)$ are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enthropy is also used quite a bit in machine learning. A good example are the classification trees. The following description comes from Andrew Ng. The tree starts with a root node that presents a choice between examples that exhibit a particular feature or not, leading to two child nodes that contain examples with and without that feature. Each child poses yet another choice that leads to two more children, and so on. The process ends with any number of leaf nodes, each of which, mostly or wholly, contains examples of one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To grow, the tree must find the root decision. To choose, it considers all features and their values and chooses the one that maximizes the purity of the split (Optimal purity is defined as 100 percent of examples of one class going to a particular child node and none going to the other node.) This is where entropy comes to play, as it measures the purity of the split, or the disorder in the split. Splits are rarely 100 percent pure (enthropy is 0 for 100% pure splits) after just one decision and may never get there, so the process continues, producing level after level of child nodes, until purity doesn’t rise much by considering further features. At this point, the tree is fully trained.\n",
    "At inference, a fresh example traverses the tree, which evaluates a different decision at each level from top to bottom. The example takes the label of the data contained by the leaf node it lands in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, e.g., we want to classify customers into two classes, likely to churn (or drop our service) and not likely to churn (admittedly very simplified). Then, we collect data on churn together with lots of other attributes, such as demographics (where you live, gender, age, etc.), and data about the customer's business (like how often do they use our service, have they complained before, how long have they used our service, etc.). When we start looking at our data, we may see that 5% of our customers churn - this can then be seen as our base distribution. We then go through all of our data attributes to see which one reduces the enthropy most. E.g., when we look at complaints, we split the data into two groups, one for those who ahev complained, and one for those who have not complained. We then measure the enthropy in each group, and combine them together using the population proportions in each group. If this new enthopy is lower than the one we started with, then we have some information gain by splitting the data this way. The first step is to perform this operation on all data attributes and choose the attribute that gives is the highest information gain. Then, we repeat the process for each of the subgroups, etc. until we have a decent classification tree for the classes of interest.\n",
